git branch -> list local branches
git branch -r -> list all branches

git remote show origin -> see branches that exist in the remote 'origin' and their local version

git push origin :<branch_name> -> delete remote branch 
git branch -d <branch_name> -> delete branch 
git branch -D <branch_name> -> delete branch 

git remote prune -> clean all stale (those who had a remote version, but that remote version was deleted) branches

git push origin <local_branch_name>:<remote_branch_name> -> push changes from local_branch_name to remote_branch_name

a TAG is a name, a reference given to a specific commit, like HEAD that is always pointing to the last commit done in the working branch

git tag -> list tags
git checkout <tag_name> -> checkout the tag, that commit to which the tag is pointing to
git tag -a <tag_name> -m "tag description" -> create a tag in the last commit 
git push --tags -> push the tags

challenge:

git push origin hamsters
git branch -r
git fetch
git branch -r
git push origin :weasel
git remote show origin
git remote prune origin
git tag
git tag -a v1.3.2 -m "v1.3.2 tag"
git push --tags origin
git checkout v1.3.1
